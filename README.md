# ETH Information Retrieval course projects (Autumn 2016)
## Project 1: Text Categorization
In the first project we implement a text categorization system that automatically discovers the topic, region and industry of news articles. We implement three algorithms: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression and SVM.

## Project 2: Retrieval System
In the second project we implement a search engine that, from a large collection of documents, returns a list of the most relevant documents for a number of queries. The system offers multiple relevance models: one term-based model and one language model
